## Description
In this _untitled_ game, you play as a person trying to find and defuse a bomb hidden underneath the city.\
The grid, or game board, is randomly generated every time with different types of "tiles".\
Basically, you move around while using PINGs (an action to determine your distance from the bomb) to find the bomb and save the city.\
You have a limited amount of actions to find the bomb, so you should plan out your path accordingly.
